<p>I've recently taken on <a href="https://www.theodinproject.com/">The Odin Project</a> and it's very rewarding. You not only gain developing experience, but you also learn web development concepts on a deeper level. For every new project, I try and incorporate new knowledge and new methods of doing things so that my skills are always growing.</p>
